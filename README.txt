This project is using CLion (with MinGW, GNU 8.2.0)

Libraries Used:
- SDL2, SDL_ttf, SDL_image

When I started with the exam, my goal was to make it easy to manage objects and SDL in general.
I managed to accomplish this by creating higher level methods for creating surfaces and textures.

I believe my result could overall (in terms of gameplay) be improved to a great degree due to there being a fair bit
of bugs related to the core gameplay. In terms of the code that was written to handling SDL and rendering of text and
images, I believe the result was great since it simplifies prototyping something and overall reduces the time spent 
managing everything.

Problems with the solution:
- Actually gameplay is way too simple
- Gameplay is buggy
- Not enough polish
